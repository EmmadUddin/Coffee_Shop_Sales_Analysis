Here are some key analyses we conducted:

Peak Hours and Busiest Day: Revealed that the busiest hour is 𝐛𝐞𝐭𝐰𝐞𝐞𝐧 𝟏𝟎-𝟏𝟏 𝐀𝐌, 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐲𝐬 emerging as the peak day for foot traffic.
Product Category Contribution: Discovered that 𝐜𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐞 (𝟑𝟗%) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐞𝐚 (𝟐𝟖%) are the primary revenue contributors.
Store Location Performance: Identified that 𝐋𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐧 lags slightly behind other locations in performance.

Additionally, we conducted analyses on top-selling products and customer-preferred order sizes.

These insights provide stakeholders with the necessary tools to optimize staffing, inventory management, marketing strategies, and product offerings, thus enhancing shop revenue and customer satisfaction.
